# Configuration options for how to run FHI-aims

[docker]
# The code to use. This may maybe more than just the name of the code, and variables in
# braces {} will be expanded. For example:
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command

# code = fhi-aims

# The name and location of the Docker container to use, optionally with the version

# container = ghcr.io/molssi-seamm/seamm-fhi-aims:{version}

# In addition, you can specify the platform to use. This is useful on e.g. Macs with
# app silicon (M1, M3...) where the default platform is linux/arm64 but some containers
# are only available for linux/amd64.

# platform = linux/amd64

[local]
# The type of local installation to use. Options are:
#     conda: Use a conda environment
#   modules: Use the modules system
#     local: Use a local installation
#    docker: Use a Docker container
# By default SEAMM installs FHI-aims using conda.

# The command line to use, which should start with the executable followed by any options.
# Variables in braces {} will be expanded. For example:
#
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
#
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command.
# For a 'local' installation, the command line should include the full path to the
# executable or it should be in the path.
