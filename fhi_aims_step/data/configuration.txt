# Do not print atom data to the output if there are more than this
# many atoms. Defaults to 25

# max-atoms-to-print = 25

# How many cores to use for FHI-aims.  Set to 1 to always run serial.
# FHI-aims will try to choose a reasonable number of
# cores based on the size of the system and other parameters. The
# option 'atoms-per-core' can be used to tune this estimate.
#
# The default is 'available', meaning use all the cores available to
# the calculation if that makes sense based on the type of
# calculation. Otherwise you can give a number here. Note that the
# [DEFAULT] section may override the default.

# ncores = available

# The optimal number of atoms per core. You may wish to change this if
# you consistently use expensive functionals, or have e.g. GPUs. The
# default is 5.

# atoms-per-core = 5

# Whether to write local HTML files for the graphs, etc. generated so
